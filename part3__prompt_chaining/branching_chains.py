# We will create a branching chain that classifies the severity of a vulnerability and generates a response based on the severity level.
# The chain will consist of a classification template, a model, and branching chains for critical, high, medium, and low severity vulnerabilities.
# The branching chains will generate responses based on the severity level of the vulnerability.
# The classification and response generation chains will be combined into one chain.
