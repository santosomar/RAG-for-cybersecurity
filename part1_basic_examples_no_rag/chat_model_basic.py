# Import the required libraries
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Load environment variables from .env

# Create an instance of the ChatOpenAI model with the model name
model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

# Interact with the model by invoking it with a message
# The message is a string that represents the input to the model
# The result is a dictionary that contains the response from the model
